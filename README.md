# Cough Detection

This project demonstrates different data-driven approaches for the detection of coughs in patients with respiratory illnesses. The dataset used is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19XyGihClOE4Vn0dM0IqQI1wA8NfZ9SQI/view?usp=sharing). It consists of 135 cough files and 52 non-cough files from Google's [AudioSet](https://research.google.com/audioset/), 40 cough files and 1,960 non-cough files from the [ESC-50](https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50) dataset, and 256 cough files and 10,801 non-cough files from the [FSDKaggle2018](https://zenodo.org/record/2552860#.XwscUud7kaE) dataset. The `utils/download_audioset.py` file can be used to download the files from AudioSet. The following approaches were investigated:

* **MobileNetV2**: In `mobilenetv2/main.py`, the `AudioDataset` class from `mobilenetv2/AudioDataset.py` is used to load data, the `train` function from `mobilenetv2/train.py` is used to train the net, the `validate` function from `mobilenetv2/validate.py` is used to validate, and finally, the `test` function from `mobilenetv2/test.py` is used to test.
* **SVM**: The `Net` class in `svm/net.py` creates the network architecture detailed in [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01369) paper and loads the parameters from `svm/mx-h64-1024_0d3-1.17.pkl`. This network is then used in `svm/extract_features.py` to extract 1024-dimensional feature vectors from files in the dataset, which are saved in `svm/X.npy` and their associated labels are saved in `svm/labels.pkl`. This implementation is loosely based on [this](https://github.com/anuragkr90/weak_feature_extractor) one. Finally, the features vectors in `svm/X.npy` and their labels in `svm/labels.pkl` are used in `svm/main.py` to train a support vector machine with a radial basis function kernel to classify coughs and non-coughs.
